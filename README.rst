collective.contentrules.yearmonth
=================================

This package defines a content rules action similar to the the standard move one provided by Plone.
You are able to choose a root destination target folder and once applied the element will be moved into a dynamic target destination/YYYY/MM folder.
Year and month folders depend on the rule execution date and they are automatically added if not existent.
You can provide a different target folder writing your own adapter and move contents in different dynamic target folders.
